# 3 reasons-error detection, edit,avoid repetetion
 # Optimise:
TIME		SPACE	
# 3 things to run a program and their linkage with optimisation:
	TIME-->    CPU : At 1 tym 1 CPU code can run only 1 program(If a program 	is slow it will use CPU for longer duration and other programs will no get 	the CPU...)
	SPACE--> Memory(RAM)
	External files
[64]  
TIME COMPLEXITY - Measurement of time taken by a program (See the loops, count total number of operations)


*TIMSORT* : Time complexity is nlogn

# Variable (can store only one value)
# DATA STRUCTURES
1) Linear :
	array
	vector
	string->character array
	Stacks
	Queues
	Linked List

2)Heirarchical
	Trees

3)Hashing : To search an element in an array->  make another array-> Mark true/false-> Then we can directly go to the spot where req. element is placed and see if it is T/F.
		   Every language has its own hash function.    It converts large numbers into smaller ones.		
	Set 
	Maps [one key,one value]

4)Graph

# OS commands [stack is used here]
cd : change directory
cd.. : go back
ls : lists elements inside folder
